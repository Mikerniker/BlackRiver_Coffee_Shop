# blackrivercoffee_shop


I created this online coffee shop to practice Django, HTML, CSS, Python, and Bootstrap. 
I expanded an HTML and CSS project I originally submitted for Freecode Camp to include Django for backend. 
I also changed the original code I made to use Bootstrap instead. 
The main challenges I had were trying to understand the Django framework and trying to save user input. 
Currently, the project stops at Checkout, I hope to improve the backend a bit more for the Checkout process and store user input in a database for customer orders.
I also hope to improve the navigation on the website to improve User Experience.
