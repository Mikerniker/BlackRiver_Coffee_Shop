# blackrivercoffee_shop


This online coffee shop was built with Django, HTML, CSS, Python, and Bootstrap. 
I expanded an HTML and CSS project I originally submitted for Freecode Camp to include Django for backend and changed the original code I made with Bootstrap instead. 
The main challenges I had were trying building Django framework and saving user input. 
Currently, the project stops at Checkout, in the future, I hope to improve the backend a bit more for the Checkout process and store user input in a database for customer orders.
